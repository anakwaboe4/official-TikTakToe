We store positions in an int flowing the next logic.

the first 9 digits present the board and the the 10th is the next player

for the board 0 = empty, 1= X, 2 = O.

for the player we lower it by one because the int limit. so 0= X en 1= O

so: 1 121 102 001
is: 

X
O   X
X O X

with the next move being for O
